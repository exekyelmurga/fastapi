# FastAPI Practice Repository

Hello! I am Ezequiel and I have created this repository to practice with FastAPI.

## Start the Project

To start this project, you need to install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install pydantic
pip install fastapi
pip install uvicorn
```
Then run this code to launch the app.

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

After running the command, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to explore and test the different endpoints.
